# Tic Tac Toe - GUI version

This game is all about two players taking turns entering X or O in a board and trying to connect three in a line to win the game.

The same principle is used as in [my other project](https://github.com/derBanz/tic-tac-toe), see the description there for more details on the algorithm. This version is an edit to provide a GUI experience.
